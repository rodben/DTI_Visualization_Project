## Motivation

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become a valuable neuroimaging tool, mapping the trajectories of fiber tracts in the white matter of the brain, it is the application of the diffusion tensor model to the brain. While having some limitations to DTI, it is the only nonivasive imaging technique today that permits in vivo dissection of fibers within the brain and enables the characterization of its structure.  
Given their value, processing and visualization tools are being developed by science and engineer students. These students may have a hard time learning about the theories and concepts regarding DTI and DWI, since it isn't part of the science and engineer curriculum. Furthermore, most of the tools and websites available to learn about the topic are text-based and fail to provide a clear overview of the processes and results.
